# About the project

Hi, I am Juuso, currently a PhD student at the department of agricultural sciences. I have no previous experience in *R*, but some programming experience from other languages. I have started to grow an interest in datascience and have also in my research gathered quite large datasets from field experiments and hence am here to find out how to deal with them.    

The link to my Github repository is <https://github.com/jtuure/IODS-project>

```{r}
# This is a so-called "R chunk" where you can write R code.

date()

a = 1:10
b = 1:10*5

plot(a,b)

```

## Some styling of text tried out down here
The text continues here and I am trying different styles and stuff. <span style="color: red;">This is highlighted in red</span> <span style="color: blue;">and this in blue</span> This text is **bold** and this *italic*. 

Here is a very simple list:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b

by the way my Github repository can also be accessed from [here](https://github.com/jtuure/IODS-project)
